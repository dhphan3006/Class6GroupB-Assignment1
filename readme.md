# Note: Since everyone has their own tasks that require sudo privileges, we added everyone's public key to the 'ubuntu' username, which already has sudo privileges, instead of granting sudo privileges to each individual.

+ Step 6: Click the server, then choose Connect, and then choose SSH client and copy the default command provided. Next, switch to the directory where the private key file is stored. Then, open your Command Line or PowerShell on Windows, the terminal in VSCode, or Terminal on a Macbook. Finally, connect to the server with SSH by entering the command.

# Task 2: Create User Accounts for All Team Members on the Ubuntu Server.

+ Step 2: Add each person's public key to their respective home directory. 
       Run command `sudo -i -u <username>` to switch to the user and their home directory.
       Run command `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` to create .ssh directory.
       Run command `vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to create authorized_keys file where stores public key.
       Run command `chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to grant permission to user on authorized_keys file.

**2.1. Challenges: Everyone encountered difficulties connecting via SSH to their username on the first attempt.**
       **Problem: The issue stemmed from using the incorrect command to switch usernames and their respective home directories.**
       Wrong command: `sudo su <username>`. This command only switches the username but does not change the working directory from Ubuntu's home directory to the user's home directory.
       **Solution: Using the command `sudo -i -u <username>` or `sudo su - <username>` resolves this issue, as it switches both the username and the working directory to the user's home directory.**

# Task 3: Add User 'Calson' and Share Login Details.
+ Step 1: Logged in on the server using ssh and created a user calson using command `sudo useradd <calson>`.
+ Step 2: Switched user from the ubuntu user to calson user with the following command: `sudo su - calson`.
+ Step 3: Ran the following command `pwd` to verify my present working directory, then ran the command `cd .ssh` to move into the .ssh directory and created a file named `authorized_keys` with the following command: `touch authorized_keys` and `ls` to be sure the file was created.
+ Step 4: Gave permisssion to the file authorized_keys using the following command: `chmod 700 authorized_keys`.

+ Step 5: Opened the file created with a text editor with the following command: `vi authorized_keys`, and pasted the public key generated by the user Calson and closed the edited file, then ran command `cat authorized_keys` to see the key pasted. 
+ Step 6: Switched user back to ubuntu server, then ran the command `vi .ssh/authorized_keys` and pasted calsonâ€™s public key.
